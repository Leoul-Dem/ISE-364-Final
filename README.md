# ISE-364-Final
Contributions:

Leoul Demissie
 - Implemented and trained the Quantized ResNet-18 model using PyTorch’s quantization framework.
 - Analyzed size reduction and latency behavior of the quantized model.
 - Consolidated all three model implementations (ResNet, EfficientNet, MobileNet) into a unified main notebook for consistency and comparability.
 - Wrote the quantization section and contributed to the Abstract and Introduction portion of the report.
 - Ran all final training jobs on his GPU due to teammates’ hardware limitations; this is why GitHub shows him as the primary code executor.

Simran Kaila
 - Implemented and trained the EfficientNet-B0 model, including modifications for dataset class counts and fine-tuning procedures.
 - Recorded accuracy, latency, and size metrics for EfficientNet across all datasets.
 - Generated visualizations comparing EfficientNet performance to other models.
 - Wrote the EfficientNet portion of the report and contributed to the Models and Methodology section of the report. 
 - Led the writing of the final report, ensuring consistency, clarity, and alignment across all sections.

Sanchita Shrivastava
 - Implemented and trained the ResNet-18 baseline model, including dataset loading, preprocessing, and evaluation functions.
 - Set up the training pipeline for ResNet, logged results, and prepared baseline performance metrics.
 - Integrated EDA file into the consolidated main notebook.
 - Wrote the ResNet portion of the report and contributed to refining the Evaluation and Analysis portion of the report.

Sandeep Singh
 - Performed Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) on all datasets.
 - Implemented and trained MobileNetV3-Small, focusing on its efficiency characteristics for on-device use.
 - Provided dataset insight that informed expectations for model performance.
 - Wrote the EDA and MobileNet sections of the report.
